Project: Modified Spotify playlist

Project Team: Kristin Robinson (2270-315)

This program creates a playlist of songs from a set of CDs. 
The program will read in from a file a list of CDs and each song on the CD.  A user can build a playlist from the CDs and songs. The user can add a full CD or individual tracks. They can switch the order in which the songs are played and they can delete tracks or an entire CD from the playlist. The user can search CDs and tracks by musician. The program will also print the playlist when requested.
